As a Deputy President of URCA, I was in charge of the Executive Board of his university in 2006.
For the past 3 years and until the end of 2019, I am Deputy President for Research and Valorization.
From 2008 to 2015, I was at the head of the largest CReSTIC team with more than 35 people.
I also installed and managed the URCA's immersive visualization platform until 2016.
Beside the ROMEO HPC Center ranked in June 2018 as the 249th world supercomputer in the TOP500 and 20th in the GREEN500, these two prestigious instruments installed within the MaSCA – URCA’s technological platform – make URCA a unique place for education and research high-performance graphics topics.
